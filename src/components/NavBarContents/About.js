                <p>We are a variety show containing Drag, Aerial, and Pole. We started off in May of 2015 with an idea and a love of performing.
                     The idea was that since there are no places for a Drag Queen Pole Dancer to perform why not create our own show. 
                     Since we were mostly affiliated with drag we decided it would be best to add the two together. 
                     The Stud was the first place to give us a start, so we were there for 3 years doing a once a month show every first Sunday of the month. 
                     After that we moved to the powerhouse where we spent another 2 years doing a once a month show. Then the pandemic hit and we didn't know what to do. 
                     So we decided to start an online show called 
                    Pole@Home on Twitch.Tv which allowed us to start doing a weekly show. April of 2021 will be a full year online.</p>
