This is where I place ideas and such:::

I need to create the look of the pages.  They need to change with each site change and they need to envoke the feel of the party.  
But I need to create a basic look for the page as well.  I want the home page to contain images of each party and when you click on the image
it will take you to the particular party.  Also need to create pages for the sister parties that I am helping with and sponsors.  

HOME PAGE::
1. Page (Heirarchy) 
A.)  Polesexual-Productions header.  
B.) Navbar: Home, About, Sister Parties, Sponsors.  
C.) Quadrant Image layout with party names and posters so people know which party they are looking up.  
D.) Footer: Containing Contact US information and the Copyright info and such.   


EVENT PAGE::
2. Page (Heirarchy)
A.) Title of Party, Date, Time
B.) Navbar

D.) About the Party and its theme of the evening.  Poster of the night in bottom left hand corner.
E.) Footer: Contact Us, Link to location on google maps, Copyright Info
